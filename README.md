# Star Talk Reforged

## Full Stack Web Application

## MERN

## Planning

What should this folder structure look like?\  
* root
* assets - components - routes - utils - App.js - index.js = index.css - logo.svg - data.js 
* assets: images
* components: buttons - navigation = plane image - planet information = comments section - login/out - profile
* context: user.context = planets.context
* routes: authentication - planets - navigation - home - add a planet 
* utils: firebase



## Purpose

I'm taking what I've learned from [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/)'s MERN course and using it to rebuild my Coding Bootcamp's Final Project: [Star Talk](https://github.com/D-Whipp/star-talk).
