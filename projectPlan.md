# What do I want

## I want a more complete version of what I had with my original Star Talk

What does that mean?

## In the original

A user could -

- Create an account
- Login to their account
- Create a post on the main page

## With the Reforge

In addition to the above I want -

- There to be a list of pages that can be accessed where the user can discuss specific space items
- I want the user to have their own profile page
- I want better graphics per page (an image of the topic at hand)
- The ability for a user to delete their account and posts

## Nice to haves

It would be super awesome to have -

- A 3D model of the topic at hand
- A colleague's list (Much like Facebook friends)
- A place where images can be stored and referenced
